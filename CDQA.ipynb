To carry out our mission, we analyze the pertinence of the data in our possession—whether they are financial, transactional, referential, etc.—starting from their origination and capture in our systems until the moment they are consumed for internal and regulatory reports. Our goal is to understand and document the processes that mitigate data risks along its journey, identify potential flaws, to ultimately provide assurance over the data at critical points. It’s a specialization that has grown significantly since the 2008 financial crisis.',\n",
       " 'With the frameworks that have been and are being implemented, our ability to act on data-related issues is challenged by the sheer volume of data, metadata (i.e. data on data), dashboards and other data visualization tools. It can be difficult to not get overwhelmed when trouble shooting an issue, keeping a clear head, and being able to act rapidly. ‘’Data fatigue’’ is now being used to describe this across various industries and roles.',\n",
       " 'I got it almost by accident when I applied for another position within the bank! Back in Montreal, my hometown, after a career with an audit firm, I wanted to work in a global institution to satisfy my craving for new challenges and put my analytical skills to use. I applied for a position in finance production support, but the recruiter I was working with scheduled the interview for this role in Enterprise Data Management. The first 10 minutes of the discussion with my current manager were quite confusing, but since my background seemed to correspond to the job description, we had a great conversation. I wasn’t very familiar with financial institutions or data management, but coming out of the interview I knew this would be an interesting field. My manager also mentioned if I joined, I could participate in a BNPP sponsored tennis tournament, which was the last nudge I needed to sign on!',\n",
       " 'The people. Hands down, the team I work with every day, as well as all the other people I’m in touch with regularly, whether in the United States or in Paris. The department is somewhat new, and I’m grateful for the way we cheer each other on through the growing pains.',\n",
       " 'Every year, in connection with the We Are Tennis Cup organized by the bank, I take part in the regional tournament held in Canada. It’s an exciting event as the regional winners get to participate in the global tournament, but it’s above all a chance to share a fun moment between employees—on the court instead of in the office.',\n",
